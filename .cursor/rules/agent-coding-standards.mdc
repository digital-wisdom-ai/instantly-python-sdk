## Follow Clean Code principles (Robert C. Martin) when writing code

- Specifically the correct order of functions

## Be very wary of comments!

- Most likely there is absolutely no reason to add a comment
- If there is, it indicates that the code is not well written

## Don't use dicts unless required

- Use pydantic models instead, where appropriate

## Do not guess/hallucinate

- If you are not sure, ask the user
- If you don't know the library, do the research

## Only essential complexity, not accidental

- Question whether each line adds value or just complexity
